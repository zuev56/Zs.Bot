# Zs.Bot

Services directory contains application examples:
- Zs.Service.ChatAdmin - chat bot that limit users in the number of messages;
- Zs.Service.Home.Bot - now it collects VK users activity data.

It is going to be universal bot API for different messengers.
I'll fill readme some later when all base important parts would be prepared.
